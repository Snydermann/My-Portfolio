    <h2>Bio: I'm Alex Snyder, a high School Senior and aspiring coder. 
        Ever since I got a ds from my mother as young child, I have been
        interested in the technology field. I have dreams of attending Carnegie 
        Mellon University in the near future, and hopefully this class has
        brought me a step closer to that goal.

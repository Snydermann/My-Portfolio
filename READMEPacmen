Pacmen Factory

This project is a website with two buttons, "Add Pacman", and "Start Game". When Add Pacman is pressed, a "Pacman" with a random position, velocity, and direction will spawn 
somewhere in the top right corner. When start game is pressed, all the Pacmen will begin to move, bouncing when they come into contact with the borders of the screen.

Click on the corresponding index to pull up the website.
